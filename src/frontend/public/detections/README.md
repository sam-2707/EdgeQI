# Detection Images

This folder contains the real traffic monitoring images used by the EDGE-QI system.

## Images Structure:

1. `intersection_low_traffic.jpg` - Downtown intersection with moderate vehicle traffic
2. `highway_heavy_traffic.jpg` - Highway scene with dense vehicle traffic 
3. `complex_intersection.jpg` - Multi-lane intersection with mixed traffic
4. `pedestrian_area.jpg` - Pedestrian-heavy zone with people detection
5. `mixed_traffic_aerial.jpg` - Aerial view with various vehicle types

These images represent real-world traffic scenarios that the EDGE-QI system processes for:
- Vehicle detection and classification
- Anomaly detection (traffic congestion)
- Bandwidth optimization through selective transmission
- Real-time traffic monitoring and analysis
