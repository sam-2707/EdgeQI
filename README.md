# EDGE-QI: An Energy and QoS-Aware Intelligent Edge Framework

This repository contains the Python implementation of **EDGE-QI**, an intelligent framework for edge computing designed for modern IoT systems. This project is based on the research paper *"EDGE-QI: An Energy and QoS-Aware Intelligent Edge Framework for Adaptive IoT Task Scheduling"*.

EDGE-QI enables adaptive task scheduling, lightweight ML inference, and intelligent data summarization by prioritizing tasks based on context, device battery status, and network conditions. This ensures that critical tasks are executed reliably while conserving energy and bandwidth.

---

## Key Features

The framework is designed to deliver significant improvements over traditional edge computing approaches:

-   **⚡️ Adaptive Task Scheduling:** A priority-driven scheduler dynamically executes, defers, or skips tasks based on real-time system conditions.
-   **🔋 Energy-Aware Monitoring:** The system monitors device energy levels and adjusts its behavior to extend battery life, skipping non-critical tasks when energy is low.
-   **🌐 QoS-Aware Network Monitoring:** By monitoring network latency, the scheduler ensures that high-priority tasks are executed when the network quality is sufficient, improving reliability.
-   **🧠 Intelligent Data Summarization:** To save bandwidth and energy, the framework only transmits data when a significant change or anomaly is detected, filtering out redundant information.
-   **🗣️ MQTT-Based Communication:** Utilizes the lightweight and scalable MQTT protocol for efficient device-to-server communication, ideal for constrained IoT environments.
-   **🤖 Edge-Based ML Inference:** Supports running lightweight machine learning models directly on the edge device to reduce latency and enable real-time anomaly detection.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the EDGE-QI simulation on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10+
-   An MQTT Broker: The framework requires a running MQTT broker. [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is a popular and recommended choice.
    1.  Download and install Mosquitto.
    2.  After installation, ensure the Mosquitto service is running and accessible on `localhost:1883`.
    3.  Configure your firewall to allow traffic on TCP port `1883`.

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/EdgeQI.git
    cd EdgeQI
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Simulation

To see the framework in action, you need to run two scripts in separate terminals.

**Terminal 1: Start the MQTT Subscriber**

This script listens for and displays the results published by the edge device.

```bash
python App/subscriber.py
```

You should see the message: `[Subscriber] Connected to broker.`

**Terminal 2: Start the EDGE-QI Main Application**

This script initializes all the components and starts the intelligent scheduler.

```bash
python main.py
```

### Real-time Dashboard

Launch the comprehensive real-time dashboard for queue intelligence visualization:

```bash
# Quick start - check dependencies and launch
python run_dashboard.py

# Launch on custom port
python run_dashboard.py --port 8080

# Enable debug mode
python run_dashboard.py --debug
```

The dashboard provides:
- **Queue Analytics**: Real-time heatmaps, statistics, and type distributions
- **Traffic Analytics**: Flow analysis, congestion monitoring, intersection status
- **Multi-Edge Network**: Topology visualization, load balancing, health metrics
- **Performance Metrics**: System gauges, accuracy tracking, latency monitoring
- **Alert Management**: Intelligent notifications and severity classification

Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8501` after launch.

### Expected Output

In the `main.py` terminal, you will see the scheduler initializing, executing tasks, and publishing results.

Simultaneously, in the `subscriber.py` terminal, you will see the JSON-formatted messages being received from the MQTT broker.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The dashboard provides real-time visualizations of all system components and queue intelligence data.

## Project Status

The project is currently in the **simulation phase**. The core framework, including the intelligent scheduler, monitors, and summarizer, is fully implemented and functional in a simulated environment.

## Future Work

The next steps to advance this project from simulation to a real-world application include:

-   **Implement Quality-Aware Inference:** Integrate logic into the scheduler to dynamically switch between different ML model versions (e.g., full-precision vs. quantized) based on resource availability.
-   **Develop the Application Dashboard:** Build a web-based dashboard using a framework like Streamlit or Dash to visualize the incoming data in real-time.
-   **Integrate Real Hardware:** Replace the simulated sensor data with real data from hardware sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson Nano.
-   **Expand Unit Tests:** Add comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and robustness of the framework.
