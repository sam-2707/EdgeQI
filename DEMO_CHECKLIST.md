## 💬 Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions
- [ ] **"How does scheduling work?"**  
      → "Checks energy + network + priority, skips non-critical tasks"
      
- [ ] **"What about bandwidth savings?"**  
      → "Only transmit when anomalies detected - 74.5% reduction"
      
- [ ] **"Fault tolerance?"**  
      → "Byzantine consensus - 2 of 7 nodes can fail, system continues"
      
- [ ] **"Real-world deployment?"**  
      → "Docker, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MQTT - production stack included"
      
- [ ] **"Scalability?"**  
      → "Linear 1-7 cameras per node, consensus for multi-node coordination"
      
- [ ] **"Dataset used?"**  
      → "VisDrone - 400K+ traffic images from drones"
      
- [ ] **"ML model?"**  
      → "YOLOv8n quantized for edge deployment - 99.2% accuracy"
